        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p lang="en">In this project, we worked as a team to design for the start-up Partiful. Their product, primarily targeting 
          Gen Z and Millenials, enables users to create event pages and send invites to friends, and their mission is to foster 
          real-world connections through technology.</p>
        <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
        <div class="style-guide">
          <img id="project-pic-small" src="./assets/partiful-current.gif" alt="A gif of the original Partiful app homepage"/>
          <p lang="en" class="style-desc">Partiful's existing design requires the user to scroll to the right horizontally 
            and click into a filter to view their past events. The main drawback of this design is that it can be difficult 
            for users to find their past events because they are not easily available on the landing page.</p>
        </div>
          <p lang="en">Their main goal was for us to redesign their mobile app homepage to more prominently feature a user's 
            past events. According to the founders, whom we corresponded with via email and on a shared project brief document, 
            their main metrics were as follows:
            <br><br>Customer Pain Points:
            <ul>
                <li>As a host, it’s difficult to navigate back to a past event to reminisce or utilize helpful Partiful features 
                  like Text Blast.
                </li>
                <li>As a guest, it’s difficult to navigate back to a past event to reminisce, ask for photos, or view already
                   posted photos.
                </li>
                <li>It’s difficult to find the people you recently partied with to either look them up on another platform 
                  (Instagram) or ask friends about them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Discussing the brief with the founders cleared up a lot of questions we had. In particular, the founder’s assertion 
            that it was very difficult for the average user to navigate to past events as well as the greater goal of improving 
            the app’s learnability was a great starting point.</p>
        <h3>Visual Redesign</h3>
        <h2>⟡ Part I: Sketching and Brainstorming</h2>
        <img id="original-project-pic-1" src="./assets/iterative-sketch.png" alt="A rough sketch I completed of a possible design"/>
        <p lang="en">Above is one of the two sketches I produced for my team. My main mindset was building off the existing Partiful 
          framework but adding a new section solely dedicated to past events. I also utilized a larger card featuring some brief 
          information about each event in hopes of making the design more understandable to the user.
        </p>
        <h2>⟡ Part II: Wireframing and Initial Feedback</h2>
        <p lang="en">As a team, we shared our sketches and dicsussed a plan to move forward. From here, we created multiple 
          low-fidelity wireframes, with the design we decided on displayed below.</p>
          <div class="style-guide">
            <img id="original-project-pic-1" src="./assets/iterative-basic-lofi.png" alt="An image of the lo-fi wireframe we collectively produced"/>
            <p lang="en" class="style-desc">In our design, we hoped to address the main concern of Past Events being difficult for users 
              to access. We also wanted to improve the searchability of events overall through adding a search bar. Finally, because a user 
              is more likely to have more past events than upcoming events, we decided to implement a vertical scroll for past events and 
              horizontal scroll for upcoming.</p>
          </div>
          <p lang="en">After we finalized our first wireframe, we got the opportunity to contact the Partiful founders and get their direct 
            feedback on it. They encouraged us to think outside the box and propose multiple more creative solutions to 
            displaying Past Events, so we took this to heart and decided to diversify our work by incorporating new ideas. 
            <br><br>This resulted in the production of two more lo-fi prototypes, both of which featured ideas I came up with.
          </p>
          <img id="original-project-pic-1" src="./assets/iterative-creative-lofi.png" alt="An image of the new lo-fi prortype we created"/>
          <p lang="en">The new ideas I came up with were a social media-esque feed design, where each event has its own "post" that users can 
            scroll through and interact with. Within these "posts," status updates of users RSVPing or commenting on an event will update the post. 
            The other one I proposed was a map view, where all events would appear by location based on a user's surroundings.
          </p>
        <h2>⟡ Part III: High-Fidelity Prototyping and Final Critiques</h2>
        <p lang="en">The Partiful team shared their style guide with us, and we began working on our high-fidelity prototypes of our three ideas. 
          We created three hi-fis with our three ideas: our basic solution, feed-based social media-esque design, and lastly a map view.
        </p>
        <img id="original-project-pic-1" src="./assets/iterative-hifi.png" alt="An image of the original site with specific pain points highlighted"/>
        <p lang="en">This time, we got the opportunity to meet directly with the Partiful founders via Zoom call for a final round of critiques. 
          The feedback they gave us was as follows:
          <ul>
          <li>Basic: The founders were receptive to this idea and felt it made Past Events more accessible. They did prompt us to consider if we want to 
            expose guest lists for all upcoming events from the homepage (top level), as then it would eliminate the need for users to click onto an event. 
            They suggested a system where currently occurring events would have all the information displayed, but other upcoming events could be smaller cards. 
            They liked the idea of displaying mutuals on the main page, as this encourages interactions between mutuals (including sending emojis and chatting).</li>
          <li>Feed: The founders viewed the activity feed as a separate page in addition to the main page, but felt it was a little too cluttered to be the landing 
            page itself. They encouraged us to take the concept and play with the hierarchy of information, and also prompted us to think about other ways to display 
            these notifications - do we need timestamps for each card? They did agree that this feed design would incentivise people to click on event cards, but 
            wanted us to explore other gestures for the iOS app and suggested visual changes like stacking user avatars, which could be clicked on or pinched to 
            expand information.</li>
          <li>Map: This proposal was received with enthusiasm, as one of the founders we spoke with had previously pitched a similar idea. They were interested 
            in seeing how we can combine past events and upcoming events into one map, especially how we could visualize past events as a heat map. They also 
            suggested utilizing animations such as pulsing icons to draw user attention to ongoing events.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          With that meeting, our project reached its conclusion. Overall, it was a great experience in learning how to work with a team towards a final goal. 
          I feel I learned so much from getting to interact with and receive feedback from real-world founders; working through the steps of sketching, lo-fi 
          wireframes, hi-fi prototyping, then modifying our designs based on critiques was invaluable to the development of my design skills and ability to work with others.
