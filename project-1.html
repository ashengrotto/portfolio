        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p lang="en">I decided to undertake the project of creating a comprehensive redesign of the homepage for a private cat breeding business.  
            This project has a special place in my heart because I've always loved cats, especially since I fostered kittens for the local Humane Society for over 4 years and am familiar with the pain of parting with an animal you've grown to love.</p>
        <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
        <p lang="en">To begin, I identified a few pain points in the original site that I wanted to improve upon in my redesign. I found that the original site's organization was rather cluttered and overwhelming, with the decorative background and color scheme providing poor contrast (among other issues).
        </p>
        <div class="original-pics">
            <div class="original-desktop">
                <img id="original-project-pic-1" src="./assets/desktop-original.png" alt="An image of the original site with specific pain points highlighted"/>
            </div>
            <img id="original-project-pic-2" src="./assets/mobile-original.png" alt="An image of the original site with specific pain points highlighted"/>
        </div>
        <h3>Visual Redesign</h3>
        <h2>⟡ Part I: Sketching and Brainstorming</h2>
        <img id="project-pic" src="./assets/sketches.jpg" alt="An image of my speed sketch designs"/>
        <p lang="en">With this in mind, I started the process of sketching, spending about a minute on each one.
            <br><br>From these brainstormed ideas, I synthesized a few elements I wanted to include in my final redesign. Namely:
            <ul>
                <li>A single, main image on the page that could attract attention</li>
                <li>Shortening the the introduction text amd moving it to the right of the main image</li>
                <li>Maintaining the top navigation bar but trimming down the number of links, and adding a bottom bar to hold contact information</li>
                <li>Using a decorative element to break up the information, either a gallery (desktop) or a quote (tablet/mobile)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>⟡ Part II: Wireframing</h2>
        <p lang="en">I began with making lo-fi wireframes for three screen sizes: for desktop, tablet, and mobile.</p>
        <img id="project-pic-large" src="./assets/all-lofi.png" alt="An image of my lo-fi prototypes"/>
        <p lang="en">As you can see, I streamlined the desktop design by removing the automatic music player and condensing the number of links.
             I planned to do this thoughtfully by combining related pages and using dropdowns to group related information, 
             and attempted to retain the quality of information presented by the site.
            
            <br><br>
            The mobile and tablet redesigns are more similar in nature, both featuring a dropdown instead of a traditional navigation bar for ease of tapping with fingers (which are less precise than a mouse). </p>
        <h2>⟡ Part III: Visual style guide</h2>
        <div class="style-guide">
          <img id="project-pic-small" src="./assets/redesign-style-guide.jpg" alt="An image of my style guide"/>
          <p lang="en" class="style-desc">Then, I created a style guide on Figma to ensure consistency before I start on finalizing the designs. I brainstormed a color scheme, decided on icons for social media links, and standardized text sizes and fonts. I also finalized button and link hover behavior.</p>
        </div>
          <!-- //move text to right of style guide -->
        <h2>⟡ Part IV: High-Fidelity Prototyping</h2>
         <!-- //label tablet, mobile, desktop -->
        <p lang="en">With these designs, I returned to Figma to create three hi-fi prototypes.</p>
        <img id="project-pic-large" src="./assets/all-hifi.png" alt="An image of my hi-fi prototypes"/>
        <p lang="en">In both the tablet and mobile designs, the navigation bar is a dropdown instead of a series of links. This is to faciliate easier navigation on smaller screen sizes by offering larger buttons for users to press.</p>
        <h3>Implementation and Takeaways</h3>
        <p lang="en">As the final step, I implemented my design using HTML and CSS. The link to my final redesigned page is <a href="https://ashengrotto.github.io/responsive-redesign/">here</a>, and the Github repository is <a href="https://github.com/ashengrotto/responsive-redesign">here</a>.
        <br><br>
        This was one of the first front-to-back, responsive projects I have ever worked on, and I learned a lot about both design principles and HTML/CSS.
        Through this experience, I feel much more prepared to tackle real-world problems through design and front-end engineering.
