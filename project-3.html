        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p lang="en">In this project, we worked as a team to create a web application that allows users to track their 
          Spotify data, including information such as their most commonly played artists, genres, songs, etc., as well as view 
          the data of friends (akin to a social media site.) We also wanted the site to include a recommender system: based 
          on your listening data and the data of the people you follow, the user will be recommended artists and songs that they 
          may not have been familiar with before.</p>
        <h3>Problem Overview</h3>
        <img id="project-pic-large" src="./assets/spotify-current.png" alt="User profiles on Spotify (self and a friend's)"/>
          <p lang="en">From personal experience, we already knew that Spotify's existing design does not faciliate the 
            sharing of your own top tracks and artists. Keeping this in mind, we conducted a series of user interviews 
            with Spotify users and recorded the following information:
            <br><br>Existing Pain Points:
            <ul>
                <li>Your friend's listening habits on Spotify are not visible to you - in order to get data about how your friends
                   are using the app, you usually have to wait until they share their yearly "Spotify Wrapped."
                </li>
                <li>Especially as a result of the pandemic, university life can be an isolating experience for many, and connecting
                   with new people based on music taste is an appealing concept for the people we spoke with.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            We also conducted a competitor analysis on existing third party applications such as Stats for Spotify and Chosic, which
            offer the user information about their Spotify usage as third-party sites. The project we propose is different from these 
            existing applications because it involves the aspect of social media, in which friends can view each other’s data on a site. 
            In that way, we felt our design would succeed better than these existing approaches by introducing more of a community to 
            music data, whereas other applications are localized and do not allow for the sharing of information within the site itself.
           <br><br>
            From this analysis, we refined the goal of our project: to create a website that addresses the lack of community in 
            Spotify's current design. We hoped to build an application that allows users to share their top tracks and artists with
            their friends, view their friends' listening data, and synthesize new playlists by introducing new recommendations based 
            on friends' data.
          </p>
            <h3>Intended Audience and Stakeholders</h3>
        <p lang="en">To avoid pushing the limits of our small group, we planned to provide our application only in English; we 
          acknowledged that this may limit our user base because Spotify is a worldwide application. Even so, we felt that a great 
          number of Spotify users would be able to use our application.
          <br><br>
          From here, we outlined a few anticipated external stakeholder groups.
          <ul>
            <li>Because our application would compete with other existing social media platforms, other platforms like Instagram 
              and Tiktok may have a negative reaction to our application.</li>
            <li>Each year, Spotify releases a "Spotify Wrapped" which aggregates and displays data on a user’s listening habits 
              throughout the year. Our application would allow users to see some of this data without waiting for the "Spotify 
              Wrapped" to be released. As a result, Spotify, or other streaming services which provide similar annual
               releases for users to view their data, may view our application in a negative light.</li>
            <li>Because our web application in its current stage will only support Spotify users, non-Spotify users may feel 
              excluded from this platform.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Scope and User Stories</h3>
        <p lang="en">We proceeded to focus on the specific features we wanted to implement, so we defined the following user stories:
          <ul>
            <li>A user can create a personal profile by linking their Spotify account.</li>
            <li>A user can see their Spotify listening data, including information such as most listened to songs, artists, 
              genres, etc. </li>
            <li>A user can add friends by searching for their usernames.</li>
            <li>A user can see their friend's listening data.</li>
            <li>A user can be recommended personalized playlists, songs, and artists based on their friends' listening data 
              through a recommendation algorithm.</li>
            <li>A user can follow said recommended artists or playlists through our app by connecting to their Spotify accounts.            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p lang="en">From here, we could get into the weeds of how to achieve this vision. The crux of our project relies on 
          utilizing the Spotify API for tracking a user's listening data, as well as the following technical dependencies:<ul>
            <li>Java 17</li>
            <li>Spark Java Framework</li>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Typescript</li>
            <li>Firebase to handle authentication (secure login)</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          We also wanted to be clear about the assumptions we were making in planning and implementing our design. They were as follows:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Assumption of no copyright conflicts</li>
            <li>No legal issues with the data we are storing for users</li>
            <li>People are interested in a music-based social media platform</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>System Features and Requirements</h3>
        <p lang="en">The specific features and pages we wanted to implement were as follows:
          <br><br>
          Backend:<ul>
            <li>Database: Stores pertinent user information in a SQL database, which will be used to handle logins, searches, and 
              recommendations.</li>
            <li>Spotify API: Interfaces with Spotify in order to pull relevant data regarding listening habits of users.</li>
            <li>Recommendation System: Allows for users to get recommendations of other users with similar listening habits.</li>
            <li>Authentication System: Allows for users to create an account for the application that will be used for subsequent 
              logins. Also allows for users to link their accounts to Spotify for data scraping purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>Frontend:
          <br><br>
          <ul>
            <li>Welcome Page: Serves as the welcome page for users, giving an overview of the purpose and features available in 
              the application.</li>
            <li>User Profile Page: Gives information about the user themself and allows them to modify their own profile.</li>
            <li>Friend Search Page: Offers the functionality to search amongst the user’s friends.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Non-functional Requirements</h3>
        <p lang="en">In terms of non-technical goals we wanted to achieve, we defined the following categories:<ul>
            <li>Performance: Given the regularity with which people will use our application, the app should maintain a high standard 
              of performance, both in speed and reliability.</li>
            <li>Security: Besides passwords, we are not storing any particularly sensitive information. We will use a third party 
              service for passwords to ensure security.</li>
            <li>Privacy: We are aiming for the highest standard of privacy, with particular attention to obfuscating some data from developers 
              so that only users themselves have access to them.</li>
            <li>UI: We want to have a clean and non-distracting UI, so we will focus on effective and practical design over highly 
              flashy and attractive looks.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Final Implementation</h3>
        <p lang="en">Keeping this all in mind, we began coding our site. Within the team, I was solely responsible for the design 
          of the UI; I also assisted in integrating the frontend and backend code and worked on the overall layout and organization 
          of the various pages (profile, friends list, etc.). This experience was invaluable for the development of both my frontend and 
          backend programming skills, and I also learned a lot about user interface design. 
          <br><br>In the end, we were able to build and deploy our site, complete with a recommendation algorithm, integration 
          with Spotify's API to extract user data, and friends list system. The code is currently set to private as it was a 
          final project for a course, but feel free to reach out if you would like to see the repository!
